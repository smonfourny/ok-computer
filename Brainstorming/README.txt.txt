How to operate the CPU:
1. To add a program to the CPU, either manually enter commands into the RAM bytes OR press the ROM ON button located directly under the ROM, which is the top-left-most component.
2. If you activated the ROM, tick the clock once, then turn off the ROM.
3. Under the CU (which is located in the bottom-middle of the CPU), turn the PIN to 1 to activate the CU.
4. Enter a desired value into the Keypad located in the middle-left. Also ote that the pins are what must be pressed for any operation which uses the keypad.
5. Start the clock.
6. If the program entered uses the display, it can be found directly under the keypad (i.e. in the bottom-right).
7. To turn the CPU off, press the OnOff pin located at the top of the CPU. So long as the value of that pin is set to 1, the CPU CANNOT be used. Once it is set to 0 again, all data in the CPU will have been reset, so programs must be reloaded into the RAM.
