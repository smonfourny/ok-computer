List of things affected by on/off:
RAM (All registers + DR)
MR, AR
MAR, MBR
D0, D1
PC
IR
Display Companion Register and both ALU Data Bytes,  changed from "DATA_BYTE" to new type: "DATA_BYTE_ONOFF", which takes the On/Off

Clock is restricted
CU can only be turned on when computer is on

Note: right now the computer is "off" when the On/Off switch is set to 1: maybe consider inverting this? (Just put a NOT gate)
Note: All affected components have a new input, marked O/O.
